## Installation
üí° The install script will do two things: 
* 1. Copy the majemoji code into your `oh-my-zsh directory`.
* 2. Modify your `ZSH_THEME` variable in your `zshrc` file. 

### Automatic install
üåà Copy and paste the code below into your terminal in one thic chunk and bam you're ready to go!
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catonmat/majemoji/master/majemoji.zsh-theme >> majemoji.zsh-theme && \
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catonmat/majemoji/master/install.sh > install.sh && \
sh install.sh && rm install.sh && rm majemoji.zsh-theme && zsh
```

### Manual Install
```shell
# clone the repo
git clone [majemoji_repo_url]

# move into the directory
cd majemoji

# I encourage you to double check contents of the install script to ensure you are happy to run it! It's very simple and straightforward.
cat install.sh

# run the install!
sh install.sh

# reboot your Zsh in the terminal to see majemoji Action!!!
zsh
```

The automatic install script assumes two things: 
* The path of your `oh-my-zsh directory` is `~./oh-my-zsh directory`.
* The path of your `zshrc` file is `~/.zshrc`.
* You are willing to prefix the install script with `sudo` as you'll be moving files inside your `~` directory.

If any of the three points above are not true for you, then you'll have to manually move the files.
* Manually copy and paste the `majemoji.zsh-theme` file into your `oh-my-zsh directory`.
* Copy and paste `ZSH_THEME=majemoji` to the bottom of your `~/.zshrc` file.
* Reboot your Zsh session by running the command: `zsh`.
